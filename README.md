## 🎯 **Problem Statement**

Certifiable Inc. faced several challenges in scaling its certification process:
- **Manual grading inefficiencies** slowed test evaluations.
- **Candidate experience issues** due to strict deadlines & delays.
- **Scalability risks** as demand grew by 5-10X.
- **High AI adoption costs**, making automation challenging.
- **Administrative inefficiencies**, increasing operational overhead.
