# 🚀 Solution for System Scalability Risks at Certifiable Inc.

## 🔹 Challenge
- The current system **is not designed** to handle **5-10X growth** in certification requests.
- **Monolithic architecture & manual workflows** create **scalability bottlenecks**.
- **Slow test processing & result generation** frustrates candidates.

## 🔹 Impact
🔥 **System downtime risks** during high loads.  
⏳ **Delayed test submissions & result processing**, affecting candidate experience.

# ✅ Cloud-Native, Scalable Microservices Architecture

To ensure **seamless scalability** and **high availability**, we propose a **fully cloud-native microservices-based system** that:

1️⃣ **Breaks the monolithic system into microservices** for better scalability.  
2️⃣ **Implements autoscaling** to dynamically handle peak loads.  
3️⃣ **Uses event-driven architecture (EDA)** to process tasks asynchronously.  
4️⃣ **Deploys a load-balanced & containerized system** for resilience.

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

| **Component**                  | **Technology Stack**             |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Microservices Architecture** | Kubernetes (AKS/EKS), Docker    |
| **Event-Driven Processing**    | Kafka, Azure Event Grid, AWS SQS |
| **Database Scalability**       | Azure CosmosDB, AWS DynamoDB, PostgreSQL |
| **Autoscaling & Load Balancing** | Kubernetes HPA, AWS ALB, Nginx |
| **CI/CD for Fast Deployments** | GitHub Actions, Terraform, ArgoCD |
| **Real-Time Monitoring & Logging** | Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack |

## 🚀 How It Works

### **1️⃣ Microservices-Based Architecture for High Scalability** ⚡
✔ **Decomposes the monolithic system into microservices** handling authentication, grading, feedback, reporting, etc.  
✔ **Deploys microservices in containers (Docker, Kubernetes)** for auto-scaling.  
✔ **APIs enable modular interactions, reducing interdependencies**.

### **2️⃣ Autoscaling & Load Balancing for High Availability** 🔄
✔ **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) scales microservices** based on real-time load.  
✔ **Global Load Balancers (AWS ALB, Azure Front Door) distribute traffic efficiently.**  
✔ **Redundant instances ensure zero downtime** during high traffic.

### **3️⃣ Event-Driven Architecture for Fast Processing** ⚙
✔ **Kafka / Azure Event Grid decouples test submissions from grading**.  
✔ **Asynchronous task queues** prevent slowdowns & failures.  
✔ **Parallel processing of test results reduces latency**.

### **4️⃣ CI/CD Pipeline for Rapid Scaling & Deployments** 🚀
✔ **GitHub Actions / ArgoCD automate deployments** to ensure frequent updates.  
✔ **Immutable infrastructure using Terraform** for consistency.  
✔ **Continuous monitoring & rollback strategies prevent failures**.
