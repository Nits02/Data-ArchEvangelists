# 🚀 AI-Powered Grading System for Certification Case Study Evaluations

## **📌 Problem Statement**

Currently, **expert software architects** manually grade architecture solutions submitted by candidates. This results in:

- ⏳ **Time-consuming evaluations** due to complex, subjective answers.
- 📈 **Scalability issues** with increasing test volumes.
- ⚖ **Inconsistent grading** due to human subjectivity.
- 🕒 **Delayed certification results** for candidates.

## **✅ Proposed Solution: AI-Driven Hybrid Grading System**

A **hybrid AI-Human evaluation system** that automates grading while allowing **expert architects to review complex cases**.

## **🛠 Solution Architecture & Workflow**

1️⃣ **Candidate retrieves a case study** → From the **Case Studies Database**.  
2️⃣ **Candidate uploads an architectural solution** → Stored in **Architecture Submissions DB**.  
3️⃣ **AI Pre-Grading Engine evaluates the solution** → Scores based on defined rubrics.  
4️⃣ **Confidence-based review mechanism**:
- ✅ High-confidence scores → **Direct grading**.
- ❓ Low-confidence scores → **Expert software architects review**.  
  5️⃣ **Final grades stored in Test 2 Database**.  
  6️⃣ **Results emailed to candidates**.  
  7️⃣ **Certified candidates' data pushed to Certification Database**.

## **👨‍🏫 AI-Human Hybrid Grading Approach**

Since architecture case studies involve **subjectivity**, a hybrid grading model will be used:

✔ **AI grades straightforward cases** (80% of submissions).  
✔ **Expert Architects review edge cases** (20% flagged by AI).  
✔ **Feedback provided for improvement** using Explainable AI (XAI).

🛠 **Tools Used**:
- **Amazon Augmented AI (A2I)** for expert-assisted AI grading.
- **SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) for Explainability**.
- **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) for Transparency**.

## **⚡ Deployment & Scalability**

The system should be **cloud-hosted** to ensure high availability and performance.

### **Cloud Architecture**
✅ **Azure ML + AKS (Kubernetes) for AI model deployment**  
✅ **AWS Lambda + SageMaker for serverless execution**  
✅ **CI/CD pipeline for continuous AI model updates**  
✅ **Auto-scaling based on test volume**

---

## **📈 Expected Benefits**

- ⏳ **80% reduction in grading time**.
- 🎯 **Fair, unbiased, and standardized scoring**.
- 🚀 **Faster feedback loops for candidates**.
- 📊 **Scalability to support 10X more certifications**.
- 🤝 **Improved accuracy with hybrid AI-human grading**.

---

## **🌟 Next Steps**

📌 **Step 1**: Fine-tune AI models using past case study evaluations.  
📌 **Step 2**: Define scoring rubrics and implement weight-based grading.  
📌 **Step 3**: Deploy AI-Human hybrid model with real-world test cases.  
📌 **Step 4**: Integrate with Certification Database for seamless processing.
