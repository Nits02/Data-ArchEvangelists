## 🚀 How It Works
1️⃣ **AI Prepares Initial Feedback** 🧠
- Uses **semantic scoring** to evaluate responses.
- Matches against **golden solutions** & rubrics.

2️⃣ **AI Generates Personalized Feedback** 📝
- **Strengths Identified:** "Your response covers X, Y, and Z well."
- **Weaknesses & Gaps:** "You missed A and B, consider adding…"
- **Improvement Tips:** "To improve, focus on…"

3️⃣ **Confidence-Based Human Review** 🔍
- If AI **confidence score is low**, the response is **sent for human review**.
- Expert architects **validate and refine** AI-generated feedback.

4️⃣ **Automated Feedback Report Sent to Candidates** 📩
- Candidates receive **structured, easy-to-understand feedback**.
- Reports include **highlighted improvements & scoring breakdown**.
