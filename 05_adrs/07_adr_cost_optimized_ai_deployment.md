# 🏗 Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) - Cost-Optimized AI Deployment

## **ADR-012: Serverless AI Execution for Cost Efficiency**

### 📅 Date: 2025-02-16
### 🎯 Status: ✅ Approved

### **📌 Context**
Running AI models on **always-on dedicated infrastructure** is costly and inefficient. The **pay-per-use serverless model** allows Certifiable Inc. to **optimize compute costs while maintaining scalability**.

### **💡 Decision**
Adopt **AWS Lambda / Azure Functions** for AI inference, ensuring AI workloads only run when needed.

### **🛠 Technologies**
- **Compute:** AWS Lambda, Azure Functions
- **Containerization:** Dockerized AI models
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes with auto-scaling

### **🚀 Consequences**
✅ **Reduces idle compute costs by up to 60%**.  
✅ **Scales dynamically based on demand**.  
❗ **Requires cold start optimizations for low-latency responses**.

## **ADR-013: Hybrid Cloud AI Processing for Cost Optimization**

### 📅 Date: 2025-02-16
### 🎯 Status: ✅ Approved

### **📌 Context**
Running all AI workloads on cloud GPUs is expensive. A **hybrid approach** allows Certifiable Inc. to balance **cost and performance** by using **on-prem GPUs for batch processing and cloud GPUs for real-time inference**.

### **💡 Decision**
Use **on-prem GPUs for training & batch workloads**, while **leveraging cloud GPUs for real-time tasks**, reducing overall AI spending.

### **🛠 Technologies**
- **GPU Compute:** Spot Instances, On-Prem GPUs
- **Workload Balancing:** Kubernetes, Auto-Scaling Policies

### **🚀 Consequences**
✅ **40% cost savings on cloud AI workloads**.  
✅ **Flexible compute resource allocation based on demand**.  
❗ **Requires monitoring for workload distribution efficiency**.

## **ADR-014: AI Confidence Score Routing to Reduce Compute Costs**

### 📅 Date: 2025-02-16
### 🎯 Status: ✅ Approved

### **📌 Context**
Not all AI-generated outputs require full computational processing. **AI task prioritization** ensures **low-confidence tasks are routed to human review**, while high-confidence AI decisions are automatically approved.

### **💡 Decision**
Use an **AI Confidence Score Routing system** to determine which tasks can be automated and which require human oversight.

### **🛠 Technologies**
- **AI Confidence Score Model:** Custom-built ML Model
- **Rule-Based Routing Engine:** OpenAI API, FastAPI

### **🚀 Consequences**
✅ **Reduces unnecessary AI compute usage**.  
✅ **Maintains accuracy while lowering AI costs**.  
❗ **Requires ongoing monitoring for AI accuracy thresholds**.
