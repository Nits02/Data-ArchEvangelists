# 🏗 Architecture Decision Records (ADR) - AI-Powered Content Generation
# ADR-001: Adoption of AI for Automated Content Generation

## 📅 Date
2025-02-16

## 🎯 Status
✅ Approved

## 📌 Context
The process of updating certification content, including **multiple-choice questions (MCQs), case studies, and problem statements**, has been **manual and slow**. This has resulted in:
- **Outdated questions that reduce certification credibility**.
- **Slow adaptation to industry trends**.
- **High expert workload in content creation**.

To ensure that certifications remain **relevant and scalable**, automation is required.

## 💡 Decision
We will use **AI-powered content generation models (GPT-4, T5, BERT)** to **automate the creation of test questions and case studies**. The system will:
- **Analyze industry trends** to identify key skills.
- **Generate certification content** based on predefined structures.
- **Validate AI-generated content** using consistency and relevance checks.
- **Allow human review for flagged content** before final publication.

## 🛠 Technologies
- **AI Models:** OpenAI GPT-4, Hugging Face T5, BERT
- **Trend Analysis:** Web scraping (BeautifulSoup, Scrapy), Azure Cognitive Search
- **Validation Mechanism:** NLP Consistency Checks, FAISS for Similarity Search
- **Expert Review:** Amazon Augmented AI (A2I), Label Studio
- **CMS Integration:** React.js, FastAPI, MongoDB

## 🚀 Consequences
✅ **Faster content updates (~80% improvement).**  
✅ **Ensures certification relevance with real-time industry changes.**  
✅ **Reduces expert workload while maintaining quality.**  
❗ **Requires expert oversight for low-confidence AI-generated content.**

## 📌 Alternatives Considered
1️⃣ **Manual Content Updates** – Expert-driven but **too slow** ❌  
2️⃣ **Fully AI-Generated Content** – Fast but **lacks human validation** ❌  
3️⃣ **Hybrid AI + Human Review (Selected)** – **Best balance of speed & accuracy** ✅  

# ADR-002: AI-Powered Content Validation and Quality Control

## 📅 Date
2025-02-16

## 🎯 Status
✅ Approved

## 📌 Context
AI-generated content must be **verified for accuracy, fairness, and relevance** before being used in certifications. Without a **validation mechanism**, risks include:
- **Incorrect or biased content** in test questions.
- **Repetitive or duplicate questions reducing assessment value**.
- **Misalignment with industry best practices**.

## 💡 Decision
We will implement an **AI-powered validation engine** that:
- **Performs NLP-based content consistency checks.**
- **Identifies duplicate content using similarity matching.**
- **Detects bias and ensures fairness in questions.**
- **Uses Explainable AI (XAI) to justify AI-generated content.**
- **Routes flagged content to expert review for validation.**

## 🛠 Technologies
- **NLP Validation:** BERT, RoBERTa, T5
- **Bias & Fairness Detection:** AI Explainability (SHAP, LIME)
- **Similarity Matching:** FAISS, Sentence Transformers
- **Human Review Workflow:** Amazon A2I, Label Studio

## 🚀 Consequences
✅ **Improved accuracy and fairness in certification questions.**  
✅ **Prevents low-quality or misleading test content.**  
✅ **AI learns from expert feedback, improving over time.**  
❗ **Requires additional processing time for validation.**

## 📌 Alternatives Considered
1️⃣ **No Validation (Direct AI Output)** – **High risk of incorrect content.** ❌  
2️⃣ **Fully Manual Validation** – **Too slow and resource-heavy.** ❌  
3️⃣ **AI Validation + Human Review (Selected)** – **Balanced approach.** ✅  


# ADR-003: Integration with Content Management System (CMS) for Seamless Updates

## 📅 Date
2025-02-16

## 🎯 Status
✅ Approved

## 📌 Context
Manually updating and distributing certification content **introduces delays** in publishing new test materials. To ensure **seamless content management**, we need an **automated integration** between the AI-generated content and the **certification platform**.

## 💡 Decision
We will **integrate the AI-generated content pipeline** directly with a **Content Management System (CMS)**. The system will:
- **Automatically push validated questions into the CMS** for review.
- **Allow versioning and rollback of certification content.**
- **Support dynamic updates to live certification tests.**
- **Track AI and human-reviewed changes in an audit log.**

## 🛠 Technologies
- **CMS Platform:** Custom-built using React.js, FastAPI, MongoDB
- **Automation Workflow:** AWS Lambda, Azure Functions
- **Logging & Audit:** ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

## 🚀 Consequences
✅ **Eliminates manual bottlenecks in publishing certification content.**  
✅ **Ensures test materials are always up-to-date.**  
✅ **Improves version control and auditability.**  
❗ **Requires CMS access control to prevent unauthorized changes.**

## 📌 Alternatives Considered
1️⃣ **Manual Content Updates** – **Too slow and error-prone.** ❌  
2️⃣ **Direct AI Output Without CMS** – **No version control, high risk.** ❌  
3️⃣ **Automated AI-to-CMS Integration (Selected)** – **Best balance of automation & control.** ✅
