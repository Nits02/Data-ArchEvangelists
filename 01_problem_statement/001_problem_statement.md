Certifiable, Inc., a leading provider of software architecture certifications, is facing operational challenges due to rapid growth in demand, driven by international adoption of software architecture licensing laws. The manual processes currently in place are insufficient to handle the anticipated 5-10X increase in certification requests. This includes challenges related to the time-intensive grading of exams, managing accuracy and feedback, and maintaining the integrity of tests and case studies. As a recognized leader in the field, maintaining the credibility, accuracy, and scalability of their certification process is critical.
