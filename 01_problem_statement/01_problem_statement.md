# **Problem Statement: Certifiable, Inc. Certification System Scalability**

## **1. Business Context & Growth Challenges**
Certifiable, Inc. is a leading provider of **software architecture certification**, offering accredited certification through the **SoftArchCert System**. Due to the **global adoption** of certification requirements in **Europe, the UK, and Asia**, the company expects certification requests to **increase 5-10X**.

### **Challenges:**
- The current **manual grading** and **feedback generation** processes are **not scalable**.
- Certification request volumes will **exceed existing operational capacity**.
- Experts are **overburdened**, leading to **delayed grading and feedback loops**.

## **2. Existing Certification Process & Bottlenecks**
### **Test 1: Aptitude Test**
- **Includes:** Multiple-choice & short-answer questions.
- **Current Grading Process:**
    - Multiple-choice questions are **auto-graded**.
    - Short-answer responses **require manual grading (3 hours per candidate)**.

### **Test 2: Architecture Submission**
- **Includes:** A case-study-based architectural solution.
- **Current Grading Process:**
    - Graded **entirely by human experts**, taking **8 hours per submission**.
    - Experts provide **manual feedback**, increasing turnaround time (**1-week grading per test**).

### **Key Bottlenecks:**
1. **Manual grading workload** for expert software architects is **unsustainable**.
2. **Slow feedback loops** delay candidate progress.
3. **No automation** in evaluating architecture submissions.
4. **Inefficient administration** in expert onboarding and content updates.
5. **Limited system scalability** to support anticipated demand.

## **3. System Limitations & AI Adoption Concerns**
- **Limited expert availability** creates a grading bottleneck.
- **Current infrastructure** is **not optimized for large-scale certification processing**.
- **Concerns over AI adoption:**
    - Potential **high costs**.
    - Implementation **complexity**.
    - Maintaining **grading accuracy & certification credibility**.

## **4. The Need for AI-Powered Automation**
Certifiable, Inc. requires an **AI-driven, scalable certification system** to handle the increasing demand while ensuring grading accuracy and operational efficiency.

### **Solution Goals:**
✅ **Leverage Generative AI** for grading automation & feedback generation.

✅ **Optimize system scalability** with cloud-based microservices.

✅ **Reduce expert workload** by automating repetitive grading tasks.

✅ **Improve candidate experience** with faster feedback cycles.

✅ **Implement cost-effective AI solutions** without compromising quality.
