## **ðŸ“Œ Component Responsibilities**

| **Component**                 | **Functionality** |
|--------------------------------|------------------|
| **API Gateway**               | Routes requests, applies security policies, throttling, and authentication. |
| **Authentication Module**     | Manages OAuth 2.0, JWT-based authentication, and role-based access control. |
| **Candidate Service**         | Handles candidate registration, profile updates, history tracking, and test assignments. |
| **Test Submission Service**   | Accepts candidate tests, validates submissions, and queues tests for processing. |
| **AI Grading Service**        | Uses NLP for text grading, Computer Vision for diagram evaluation, and AI-generated feedback. |
| **Human Review Service**      | Provides expert review for AI-flagged cases, ensuring fairness in grading. |
| **Certification Service**      | Manages certification issuance, expiration, and validation. |
| **Event Processing Engine**   | Kafka/Event Grid-based message broker to handle asynchronous task processing. |
| **Notification Service**      | Sends real-time status updates via email, SMS, and web notifications. |
| **Admin & Monitoring Service** | Provides logging, analytics, system health checks, and performance monitoring. |
